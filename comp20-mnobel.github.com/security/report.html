<h1 class="title"> Security Assessment Report <br> <span class="italic">ScoreCenter</span> </h1>

<a name="intro"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The web application in question, ScoreCenter, was developed to maintain high scores for HTML5 games.  
The application is meant to allow any HTML5 game on any web domain to send
high scores consisting of the game title, player name, and score. The application
takes this information and performs various functions with it. The application can display
all received scores in the order of submission; it can display the top 10 scores in descending 
order for a specified game; and it can display a list of all the high scores for all games
played by the same specified username.</p>
<p>We have been consulted to perform a security assessment on the potentially vulnerable web
application, ScoreCenter. This is especially important for the growth and integrity of the product
and its success in terms of its popularity among online HTML5 games. Listed below
 are the security vulnerabilities found, documented, and resolved in ScoreCenter.</p>

<a name="method"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>The ScoreCenter application has been launched at <a href="http://aqueous-dusk-9652.herokuapp.com/">
http://aqueous-dusk-9652.herokuapp.com/</a>, and the source code for the application was provided for
the purposes of debugging.</p>
<p>To test the application, each of the communication processes available was tested, 
including score sending, username search, and game-associated highscore
search. The application was submitted to basic attacks, such as uploading malicious files, updating database structure or 
accessing sensitive database information. We then analyzed the source code to 
further uncover other potential security leaks, and tested our hypotheses 
by again attempting attacks as a user.</p>
<p>The Burp Suite Proxy was used to perform Man-In-The-Middle-like attacks. The Burp Proxy 
operates as a web proxy server, and sits as a man-in-the-middle between your browser
 and destination web servers. This lets you intercept, inspect and modify the raw traffic 
 passing in both directions. If the application employs HTTPS, Burp breaks the SSL 
 connection between your browser and the server, so that even encrypted data can be viewed
  and modified within the Proxy.

<a name="abstract"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>There are several security leaks and opportunities for malicious attacks on 
the ScoreCenter application. The major problems found are listed below: 
<ol>
<ul>
<li>It is incredibly simple to intercept and alter the content of data being sent to the
server, with no response or monitoring on the server-side.</li>
<li>It is also very easy to exploit the Cross Origin Resource Sharing capabilities of the site
to compromise user data.</li>
<li>Any message can be posted or injected, including potentially malicious executable 
scripts, unbeknownst to the user.</li>
<li>Any message sent to other users can contain malicious scripts. A message 
can contain javascript, which will be rendered on the page of the employee 
who receives the message or the link that includes the query form defined by the attacker.
This can take the form of annoying pop-ups, auto-redirect scripts, or even more harmful 
options.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<ol>
<li>Vulnerable to "Man-in-the-Middle"-like Attack</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>/submit.json</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="level">HIGH</span> - Anyone armed with an intercepting proxy can alter the values of 
submitted high scores, undermining the integrity of the app.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>Burp Proxy, previously described in detail as a
 tool that can be used to intercept and modify HTTP traffic passing in both directions 
 between the client and server, was used to modify values in-transit (see picture below). 
This revealed vulnerability not only opens the door to malicious content being posted 
and/or executed, but generally undermines the integrity of the app as one that can 
securely and reliably post high scores for outside games.<br /><img src="Proxy.png" class="sshot" alt="Man-in-the-Middle" /></li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>  In this scenario, attackers would have bypassed any client-side checks by modifying values after the 
 checks have been performed, and then these modified values would be submitted to the server. Thus the solution
 should be to validate user input on the server side.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>Vulnerability to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>/submit.json, /, /usersearch, /highscores.json </li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="level">HIGH</span> - An attacker may 
force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker's choosing; 
furthermore, a successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data, or even the
entire web application, if the targeted end user is the administrator account.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into
loading a page that contains a malicious request, inheriting the identity and privileges of
the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim's behalf. In the case of ScoreCenter,
 someone could exploit this web application vulnerability to submit false scores. </li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>Implement a synchronizer token pattern - i.e., 
generate random tokens that are associated with the user's current session which will be
inserted within the HTML forms and links associated with sensitive server-side operations.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<li>Vulnerability to Non-Persistent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>/usersearch</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="level">MEDIUM</span> - Can result in:
all users being presented with fraudulent web content, stolen cookie information, 
malicious code injection, or annoying pop-up messages. However, in this scenario, it is
believed that the only type of XSS possible is non-persistent, which is less destructive
than persistent XSS, in which the data provided by the attacker is permanently displayed 
on "normal" pages returned to other users in the course of regular browsing. Hence, the
level of severity is limited to medium.</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>XSS attacks are conducted where user input,
 most commonly in HTTP query parameters or in HTML form submissions, is used immediately 
 by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of 
results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the request. Because HTML 
documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and 
the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page
 without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A reflected attack is 
 typically delivered via email or a neutral web site. The bait is an innocent-looking URL,
  pointing to a trusted site but containing the XSS vector. If the trusted site is 
  vulnerable to the vector, clicking the link can cause the victim's browser to execute 
  the injected script. In ScoreCenter, ./usersearch was found to be particularly vulernable
  to such a manipulation. Sending someone the following URL is a very non-extreme example
  of what possible attacks can be executed: <span class="code"> http://aqueous-dusk-9652.herokuapp.com/usersearch?username=&lt;script&gt;alert('hacked!')&lt;/script&gt;</class>
 <br /><img src="XSS.png" class="sshot" alt="XSS" />
 </li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>Cross-site scripting can be prevented by encoding output based on input parameters,
filtering input parameters for special characters, and filtering output based on input parameters for special characters, to
name a few ideas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<a name="conclusion"></a><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p> ScoreCenter currently contains many security vulnerabilities, putting users at risk
for annoying hackers to mess up their awesome, well-deserved high scores. Based on the 
number of changes that need to be made, it is recommended that 
you hire us immediately to repair the site. The design of the site 
is quite good, and therefore these items should be kept. For approximately 
$20, most <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/">Web Dev</a> students 
could and would fix many of the security leaks on ScoreCenter.</p>
