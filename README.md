This repository was for a Web Programming class at Tufts University
Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013

My favorite project so far has been the Frogger game, project number 4.
I  didn't get to finish it (yet!) but I hope to pick it up soon. It was
a good culmination of a lot of the things that we have learned, and had
a fun result. Even though I ran out of time to finish it, it was still
entertaining to work on.

I am most proud of my status_dom work, because I was dealing with new
knowledge both in lab 5 and lab 9 and I felt I handled it well. I also
am proud of my "Where in the world is..." assignment (project 3).

I feel that this course has been incredibly beneficial and that I have
learned a lot. I will definitely be using these skills in the future,
and practicing frequently.
