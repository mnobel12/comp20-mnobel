LAB 8 README 

Note: sorry this is late ... I had a big interview yesterday that I spent
all Tuesday preparing for and then essentially all of yesterday revolved
around that!!

This lab was tested in Chrome and Firefox. 
on IE9 I am getting a "Access is denied" output 
but after lots of googling I cannot seem to find the answer. 

WHAT I DID CORRECTLY:
1 got JSON data from web API via AJAX
2 Rendered all jobs on page
3 did not add additional HTML tags inside the body
4 do not think I used jQuery...
5 possibly handled exceptions..?

I worked independently.

This took me ~2 hours with all the googling.
