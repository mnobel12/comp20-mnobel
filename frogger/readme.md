but for now...


STATUS:

What I did correctly:
- Updated README
	- lol how meta is this
- Tried to have good technical competency
	- pushed after 'milestones'
	- Tried to use good programming practices
		- Logical variable names
		- good code indentation 
	- wrote meaningful git commit messages (if not too long)
	- wrote a .gitignore file
- Basic Requirements:
	- game loads immediately
	- frogger moves around on the canvas using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
	- animated logs and cars. currently substituted pink cars for turtles (will switch!)
	- if frogger is hit by a vehicle, he loses a life. **SO FAR NOTHING IF FROGGER HITS WATER** 
	- **curently no scoring	**
- (3) Additional Implementations
	- frogger is animated to dead_frog.png if he gets killed!
	-  sound added
	- functionality for different levels pretty much ready!! 
	but bc there is no winning, i have it set up to change 
	whenever you LOSE
