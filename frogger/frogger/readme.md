Mical Nobel Assignment 2

What I did correctly: 
1) My function "level_update" is a reusable method to draw all of the required items on the canvas, every time the game needs to be refreshed (e.g. something was moved, or we are starting a new level)
2) My function "start_game" initializes game parameters lives to 3, score to 0, and level to 1 (first it is 0, but then it gets bumped to 1 when the level_update function is called in the next line).


I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
