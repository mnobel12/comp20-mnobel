tested in firefox.

things I did correctly
- Map all the stations on the Red Line using Google Maps API version 3
- Use a distinct icon marker for all the stations
- Implement a red polyline connecting all the stations
- Upon clicking a station, an info window is displayed with the name of the station and the arrival schedule (including directions)
- Detects and maps your current location via navigator.geolocation with an info window marking the location
- Display the closest red line station with approximate distance away in miles* 	(*I included this information in the info window because I wasn't totally sure how I was supposed to display it, and it was simple!)
- retrieve and display the locations of carmen sandiego and waldo (the "note" and location is in the marker title, if you hover over the icons)
- display the distance between you and carmen and you and waldo as an overlay
- used 1 css file


things I did not do correctly
- I'm not sure if this is incorrect, but I handled a couple of the xmlhttp requests in a synchronous way by setting the 'async' field in open(method,url,async) to true. it does delay the map appearing on the screen but it made it easier... also i added the loading gif



I worked alone on this project. It took me ~7 hours.
